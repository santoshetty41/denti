                <h1>Welcome to DenTi</h1>
                <p>Remember 80&#180;s, when pain on the dentist&#180;s chair was the stuff of legends, jokes and
                    nightmares? It
                    was then that Dr. Karve launched Dentech with a vision- Dental Care, the gentle way. Dentech went on
                    to change the way Thanekars looked at dental treatments. Dentech made those smiles perfect, took
                    teeth back to their original, strong selves, gave teeth the care they deserve. And it took care to
                    reduce the pain to minimum and gave high priority to the patient&#180;s comfort.

                    <br><br>
                    These values were written in Dentech&#180;s DNA and has held us in good stead over past 28 years.
                    Today, we are Thane and Mumbai&#180;s leading chain of Super Speciality Dental clinics with a team
                    of more than 40 highly qualified and trained dentists spread over five flourishing clinics across
                    Mumbai and
                    Thane. Every branch is equipped with cutting edge technology, at par with the global standards. Our
                    treatments are digitalised with Oral Scanners and dental crowns are designed using CAD (computer
                    assisted design) and CAM (computer assisted manufacturing) technology. We are also equipped with RVG
                    and OPG.
                    <br><br>

                    Patient&#180;s Personal details and medical history along with their pictures are digitally stored
                    in our
